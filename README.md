# DeepC
Basic feed-forward network implementation in C with ReLU activation and naive gradient descent with mean squared error loss.

The gradient descent seems to work from the limited testing I've done so far, but actually utilizing a dataset remains a challenge - might just use some libraries for that since it falls outside of the scope of this project.

Credit to quackduck for challenging me to do this.
